### What I learned

Something I've learned while doing this project was using the css pseudo element '::marker'. I did not know you can style bulletins and numbered lists like that.

Like in this instance here below:

```css
.prepRoseWhite li::marker {
    color: var(--primary-darkRaspberry);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [::marker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker) - This helped me styled the bulletins and numbered lists.
